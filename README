Using the Steam Web API this script will make a "gamer card" of agiven Steam Profile and return a PNG image.-----------------------------------------------------------------This script will take the users steam url/id and use it to gathertheir profile information. The info is then turned into an imagein the style of a "gamer card". This can then be returned to outputas an image file on a webpage.Example: profile = SteamProfileCard("customURLorID", "card", "template")         card = profile.drawProfileCard()         pngimg = profile.imageToFile()drawProfileCard() will return a Python Imaging Library (PIL) image object that can be further modified if desired. Otherwise, imageToFile() will save the image to a PNG format that can be easily output on a website.
